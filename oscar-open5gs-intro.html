    <aside class="notes">
Welcome and thanks for joining this session! Today we'll take a laid-back, high-level look at Open5GS—covering its technical aspects, deployment options, and how it fits in with other projects. Plus, I'll share a bit of our story and the fun behind building it.

    <h2>Our Humble Beginnings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Feb 1, 2017: Started coding from scratch</li>
      <li>Pure hobby—no external support</li>
      <li>10 months until first release</li>
      <li>Collaborated with Jihoon Lee & Jinyoung Park</li>
      <li>Forked as Open5GS; 5G stack launched in 2020</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
On February 1, 2017, I started coding Open5GS from scratch as a pure hobby project. After 10 months of work with help from friends Jihoon Lee and Jinyoung Park, we released the first version. While they later founded NextEPC for commercial purposes, I forked the project as Open5GS to maintain the open source spirit, adding our 5G stack in 2020.

  <!-- Slide 1: Overview of Open5GS Functionality -->
  <section>
    <h2>Overview of Open5GS Functionality</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Supports both 4G EPC and 5G Core Networks</li>
      <li>Modular, service-based design</li>
      <li>Key components: AMF, SMF, UPF, NRF, SEPP, etc.</li>
      <li>Robust protocol support (HTTP/2, TLS, PFCP, Diameter)</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
Open5GS bridges 4G and 5G technologies with its modular, service-based architecture. You can deploy, upgrade, and integrate each component independently—perfect for legacy 4G systems while preparing for 5G. The core includes AMF for access management, SMF for session management, and UPF for user plane functions, all supported by robust protocols.

  <!-- Slide 2: Architecture & Core Components -->
  <section>
    <h2>Architecture & Core Components</h2>
    <p><small>Flexible, Modular, and Secure</small></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Common libraries: core, security, s1ap, ngap, nas, etc.</li>
      <li>Dedicated directories for network functions: amf, mme, smf, upf, etc.</li>
      <li>Seamless integration with legacy 4G systems</li>
      <li>Advanced security with TLS and encrypted identifiers (e.g., SUCI)</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
Open5GS is built with clarity and reusability in mind. We maintain common libraries like core, security, s1ap, ngap, and nas as the foundation. Each network function is organized into dedicated directories, making development easy. Our architecture supports seamless 4G integration while providing advanced security with TLS and encrypted identifiers like SUCI.
