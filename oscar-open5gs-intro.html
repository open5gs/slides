    <h2>Open5GS: An Open Source Mobile Core Journey</h2>
    <p><small>Introduction, Architecture, Use Cases & Deployment</small></p>
    <p style="text-align: right;">Sukchan Lee</p>
    <aside class="notes">
Hi everyone, thanks for joining this session. I'm Sukchan Lee, and I started Open5GS as a personal project a few years back. Today I'd like to share what we've built and learned along the way. I'll try to cover the technical aspects, the project structure, and honestly, I'm still amazed by how supportive our community has become. When I first started coding this, I never imagined it would grow into what it is today.

    <h2>Our Humble Beginnings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>February 1st, 2017: Started coding from scratch</li>
      <li>Pure hobby project—no external funding</li>
      <li>10 months to first release</li>
      <li>Collaborated with Jihoon Lee & Jinyoung Park</li>
      <li>Forked as Open5GS; 5G stack launched in 2020</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
So, back in February 2017, I was just curious about how mobile networks actually work under the hood. I started writing code from scratch, purely as a hobby - no funding, no grand plan, just me trying to figure things out. It took about 10 months of evenings and weekends to get something working. I was lucky to have Jihoon and Jinyoung helping out during those early days. When they decided to pursue the commercial route with NextEPC, I kept the open-source version going as Open5GS. Adding 5G support in 2020 was... well, let's just say it was a learning experience.

    <h2>Overview of Open5GS Functionality</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Supports both 4G EPC and 5G Core Networks</li>
      <li>Modular, service-based architecture</li>
      <li>Key components: AMF, SMF, UPF, NRF, SEPP</li>
      <li>Robust protocol support: HTTP/2, TLS, PFCP, Diameter</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
What we ended up building is a system that handles both 4G and 5G networks. I tried to make it modular from the start because, honestly, debugging monolithic telecom code is a nightmare. The architecture includes the standard components you'd expect - AMF for access management, SMF for sessions, UPF for the data plane. We support the usual protocols like HTTP/2, TLS, PFCP. Nothing revolutionary, just trying to implement the specs correctly and make it actually work in practice.

    <h2>Architecture & Core Components</h2>
    <p><small>Flexible, Modular, and Secure</small></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Common libraries: core, security, s1ap, ngap, nas</li>
      <li>Dedicated directories for network functions</li>
      <li>Seamless integration with legacy 4G systems</li>
      <li>Advanced security: TLS and encrypted identifiers</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
From a developer's perspective, I tried to structure things the way I'd want to work with them. We have shared libraries for common stuff like core functions, security, and protocol handling. Each network function has its own directory - makes sense, at least to me. The 4G integration came from necessity - people needed to migrate gradually, not do a big-bang replacement. Security was something I was probably paranoid about from the beginning, implementing TLS everywhere and features like SUCI protection. Better safe than sorry, especially in telecom.

    <h2>Community Support</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>GitHub <a href="https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues" target="_blank">issues</a> for bug reports and feature requests</li>
      <li>Active <a href="https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/discussions" target="_blank">discussions</a> for project topics</li>
      <li>Real-time help via <a href="https://discord.com/invite/GreNkuc" target="_blank">Discord</a> community</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
I have to say, our community really surprised me. We use GitHub for the usual bug reports and feature requests, which works well enough. But the Discord server has become something special - people help each other out there way more than I ever expected. I try to jump in when I can, but honestly, the community often knows the answers better than I do. It's become this place where telecom engineers, researchers, and curious developers all help each other figure things out.

    <p>About 95 <a href="https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">contributors</a> have participated</p>
    <aside class="notes">
These numbers still seem unreal to me sometimes. Yeah, I've made most of the commits - that's what happens when you start a project from scratch and spend 8+ years on it. But having 95 people contribute code, documentation, bug reports... that's incredible. Every contribution matters, from major features to fixing typos in documentation. Some of these contributors have become essential to the project. I'm genuinely grateful for everyone who's taken the time to help improve Open5GS.

    <h2>Licensing & Business Model</h2>
    <p>
      Dual licensing model for maximum flexibility:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Open Source:</strong> GNU AGPL v3.0 for research and open projects
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Commercial:</strong> Proprietary licenses available for enterprise
      </li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
The licensing model wasn't something I planned from day one, but it evolved as the project grew. AGPL v3.0 works well for researchers and open-source projects - you can use it, modify it, just share your improvements back. For companies that need proprietary modifications or can't work with copyleft licenses, we work with partners to provide commercial licensing. It's not the most elegant solution, but it seems to work for both keeping the project sustainable and serving different use cases.

    <h2>Our Partners</h2>
    <p>Leading partners for complete mobile solutions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>NewPlane:</strong> Commercial licensing & enterprise support</li>
      <li><strong>NextEPC:</strong> High-performance systems with DPDK acceleration</li>
      <li><strong>sysmocom:</strong> Open source consulting & training services</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
I'm fortunate to work with some great partners who understand both the technical and business sides of this. NewPlane handles the commercial licensing side and provides enterprise support - they're much better at that than I am. NextEPC brings high-performance implementations with DPDK acceleration, which is pretty cool to see. And sysmocom has deep expertise in open-source telecom - they help people actually deploy and run these systems successfully. Together, we cover everything from hobbyists experimenting at home to production deployments.
