    <h2>Open5GS: An Open Source Mobile Core Journey</h2>
    <p><small>Introduction, Architecture, Use Cases & Deployment</small></p>
    <p style="text-align: right;">Sukchan Lee</p>
    <aside class="notes">
Hello everyone, and thank you for joining this online session! I'm Sukchan Lee, the founder of Open5GS. Over the next 9 minutes, I'll share our journey building an open-source mobile core network, covering the technical highlights, architecture, and real-world applications. For those joining us online, I hope this presentation provides valuable insights into the world of open-source 5G technology.

    <h2>Our Humble Beginnings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>February 1st, 2017: Started coding from scratch</li>
      <li>Pure hobby project—no external funding</li>
      <li>10 months to first release</li>
      <li>Collaborated with Jihoon Lee & Jinyoung Park</li>
      <li>Forked as Open5GS; 5G stack launched in 2020</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
Let me start with our origin story. On February 1st, 2017, I began coding Open5GS from scratch as a pure hobby project—no funding, no corporate backing, just passion for mobile networks. After 10 intensive months, working alongside my colleagues Jihoon Lee and Jinyoung Park, we released our first version. While they later founded NextEPC for commercial purposes, I maintained the open-source spirit by forking the project as Open5GS. We added our complete 5G stack in 2020, making it one of the first comprehensive open-source 5G cores available.

    <h2>Overview of Open5GS Functionality</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Supports both 4G EPC and 5G Core Networks</li>
      <li>Modular, service-based architecture</li>
      <li>Key components: AMF, SMF, UPF, NRF, SEPP</li>
      <li>Robust protocol support: HTTP/2, TLS, PFCP, Diameter</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
So what exactly does Open5GS do? We've built a comprehensive solution that bridges the gap between 4G and 5G technologies. Our modular, service-based architecture means you can deploy and upgrade each component independently—perfect for organizations transitioning from legacy 4G systems to 5G. The core includes essential network functions like AMF for access management, SMF for session management, and UPF for user plane functions. All of this is supported by industry-standard protocols including HTTP/2, TLS for security, and PFCP for control plane communication.

    <h2>Architecture & Core Components</h2>
    <p><small>Flexible, Modular, and Secure</small></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Common libraries: core, security, s1ap, ngap, nas</li>
      <li>Dedicated directories for network functions</li>
      <li>Seamless integration with legacy 4G systems</li>
      <li>Advanced security: TLS and encrypted identifiers</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
The architecture of Open5GS is designed with developers in mind. We maintain shared libraries like core, security, s1ap, ngap, and nas as our foundation—this means consistent behavior across all components. Each network function lives in its own dedicated directory, making development and debugging straightforward. What's particularly powerful is our seamless 4G integration capability, allowing operators to gradually migrate to 5G. Security is built-in from the ground up, with TLS encryption and advanced features like SUCI for protecting user identities.

    <h2>Community Support</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>GitHub <a href="https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues" target="_blank">issues</a> for bug reports and feature requests</li>
      <li>Active <a href="https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/discussions" target="_blank">discussions</a> for project topics</li>
      <li>Real-time help via <a href="https://discord.com/invite/GreNkuc" target="_blank">Discord</a> community</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
One thing I'm particularly proud of is our vibrant community. We've built multiple support channels to help users at every level. For technical issues and feature requests, we use GitHub issues and discussions. But what really sets us apart is our Discord community—it's where real-time collaboration happens. Whether you're a telecom engineer, a researcher, or just curious about 5G technology, our community welcomes everyone. The response time is incredible, and the knowledge sharing is outstanding.

    <h2>Licensing & Business Model</h2>
    <p>
      Dual licensing model for maximum flexibility:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Open Source:</strong> GNU AGPL v3.0 for research and open projects
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Commercial:</strong> Proprietary licenses available for enterprise
      </li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
Let's talk about our business approach. We use a dual licensing model that serves both the open-source community and commercial needs. The GNU AGPL v3.0 license is perfect for researchers, academics, and open-source projects—you get full access to modify and distribute the code. For commercial deployments that require proprietary modifications or don't want to share their changes, we offer commercial licensing through our trusted partners. This model has proven successful in sustaining the project while keeping it freely available for innovation.

    <h2>Our Partners</h2>
    <p>Leading partners for complete mobile solutions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>NewPlane:</strong> Commercial licensing & enterprise support</li>
      <li><strong>NextEPC:</strong> High-performance systems with DPDK acceleration</li>
      <li><strong>sysmocom:</strong> Open source consulting & training services</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
We work with three key partners to provide comprehensive solutions. NewPlane handles our commercial licensing and provides enterprise-grade support—they're your go-to for production deployments. NextEPC offers high-performance, carrier-grade systems with DPDK acceleration—they're actually the commercial evolution of our early collaborative work. And sysmocom brings deep open-source expertise, offering consulting and training services to help organizations successfully deploy and maintain Open5GS. Together, we cover everything from hobbyist experiments to carrier-grade deployments.

    <h2>What's Next for Open5GS?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Continued 5G-Advanced features</li>
      <li>Enhanced cloud-native deployment</li>
      <li>Growing ecosystem integrations</li>
      <li>Stronger community collaboration</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
Looking ahead, we're excited about several developments. We're continuously adding 5G-Advanced features to stay current with the latest standards. Cloud-native deployment is a major focus—making Open5GS even easier to deploy in Kubernetes and containerized environments. We're also seeing fantastic ecosystem integrations with projects like srsRAN and other open-source radio solutions. But most importantly, we're focused on growing our community collaboration. The future of telecommunications is open source, and Open5GS is leading that charge.
