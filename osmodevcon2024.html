Hello. I'm Sukchan Lee, the developer of Open5GS.

I'm very happy to be here in Germany again after 6 years.

Today I'm going to share what makes me think about developing Open5GS.

Why did I implement that feature in the first place?

Why did I change that config file?

I'm here to share these thoughts.

HTTP2 is the interface used by 5G. Whereas 4G primarily used Diameter, 5G uses HTTP2. And TLS is used to secure the HTTP2 protocol. As we'll see later, TLS is essential for 5G roaming to connect different carriers. So I was going to do this, but someone in the community implemented it. Thank you!

A new feature in 5G is encrypted IMSI. In 4G, capturing S1AP exposes the IMSI. In 5G, you can protect your IMSI with the SUCI Scheme.

When two UPFs are associated with a single SMF, you can configure the UPFs as redundant. If the first UPF goes down, the second UPF ensures uninterrupted service delivery to UEs.

          <aside class="notes">
Basically, this functionality was provided by Pau or pespin in osmocom.

In order to monitor the various Open5GS programs, we need some sort of system for measuring metrics.

For this purpose, support for counters has been added to open5gs by adding a kind of generic API for counters, gauges, etc.

For the backend/implementation of that API, Prometheus was used, which by default requires an HTTP server to be running in the Open5GS process that serves the metrics.

The Prometheus client library, prometheus-client-c, actually contains two libraries: libprom and libpromhttp.

Libprom implements the format of the counters to pass to prometheus, and libpromhttp is a very small library that provides an http server that uses libmicrohpttd underneath it.

          <p>
            <small>
              Framed Routing allows a range of IP addresses or prefixes to be reachable over a single PDU Session, supporting IP networks behind a UE for IPv4 and IPv6 sessions.

          <p>
            <small>
              The Session Management Function (SMF) provides Framed Route information to the User Plane Function (UPF), and updates or releases PDU Sessions based on changes in Framed Route information from DN-AAA or UDM sources.

          </p>
          <aside class="notes">
One of the exciting features of 5G is the implementation of UEs as routers or CPEs.

You can implement this with the Generic feature.

This is through Frame Routing, which is described in TS23.501 Seciton 5.6.14.

Normally we assign a single IP to a UE, but Frame Routing allows us to assign multiple IPs to a UE, expressed in subnets.

The simplest way to use this feature is to provide frame routing information to the subscriber database. You can specify the IP ranges that the UE router or CPE should cover in terms of the mask bits used by the subnet, as shown in the screen. This feature is also available for IPv6.

            Overview of PFCP Restoration
          </h2>
          <p>
            <small>
              PFCP is a 3GPP protocol used in 5G core networks and 4G/LTE EPC to define the interactions between SMF and UPF or between SGW-C and SGW-U.
            </small>
          </p>
          <p>
            <small>
              Across PFCP based interfaces, an SGW-C, SGW-U, SMF and UPF Node shall utilize PFCP Heartbeat Request and Heartbeat Response messages to detect and handle a peer PFCP entity failure or restart.

          <aside class="notes">
The PFCP protocol was defined to pass data back and forth between the control plane and the data plane.

For EPC, the SGW can be separated into SGW-C and SGW-U. PGWs can be separated into PGW-C and PGW-U. In 5GC, SMF and UPF were separated from the beginning.

Therefore, if one NF terminates abnormally, a Context mismatch occurs.

How do we resolve this?

Heartbeat Request/Response is exchanged periodically between the two.

By checking the Recovery Time in Heartbeat, we can determine if the other one has terminated abnormally.

This allows us to restart the abnormally terminated NF, which should recover the Context.

          <aside class="notes">
Suppose an SMF or SGW-C in the Control Plane is abnormally terminated. If a UPF or SGW-U in the Data Plane detects this, it can simply delete all UE information in memory. All PFCP information in Control and Data can start in the initialized state.

Imagine that you have terminated with the UPF or SGW-U in the Data Plane. When the SMF or SGW-C in the Control Plane detects this, it cannot just delete the UE information. This is because the SMF has the F-TEID information assigned by the UPF.

Therefore, it is necessary to allow the UPF/SGW-U to generate PFCP information with the same F-TEID. This can be done by sending a PFCP session establishment request message with a restoration indication flag.

SEPP is an NF that was created for roaming in 5G.

It can be deployed with or without SCP.

A redesign of the Open5GS 5G Core was required for SCP and SEPP.

This is because they have different ways of discovering NFs.

Therefore, I implemented SCP and SEPP as a top priority before all other features.

NFs are deployed in the Home and Visited networks as shown below.

There are two SEPPs in between, connecting HPLMN and VPLMN with N32 interfaces.

And since the N32 interface needs to be secured, TLS is commonly used.

Note that in the figure below, the SCP connection is omitted, and other interfaces except N32 are often deployed without TLS.

            Challenges:

          <aside class="notes">
To implement the 5G Roaming feature, we should consider how to have users set up the TLS and N32 interfaces described earlier.

But there were a few challenges to overcome.

The configuration file used until v2.6.x was inflexible.

First of all, the way TLS is configured is inconvenient.

The N32 interface, which we described earlier, required a new way to configure it.

Also, N32 needs to be configured in two parts, N32-c and N32-f for control and forward, which seemed almost impossible.

So I had to redesign it with a new formatted config file, and I set out to change all of this.

Let's talk about how to set up SEPP.

First, SEPP needs to set up TLS for a secure connection.

TLS can be applied to multiple interfaces with a single certificate in common.

So, I added the keyword default: to support this common approach.

SEPPs have SBI interfaces in the same way as other NFs.

Also, it requires an additional N32 interface that is protected by TLS.

The N32 interface separates Control and Forward, so you can configure N32-f separately.

We are looking at an example where N32-c and N32-f use a common TLS certificate, but the interfaces are created separately.

A network or carrier can be identified and distinguished by its PLMN-ID. 

To use roaming with SEPP, the Serving PLMN-ID must be defined in the NRF.

Other NFs, such as AMFs and SMFs, receive the Serving PLMN-ID information during the NRF registration phase.

Therefore, all NFs know which PLMN-ID is used as the Serving Network.

For HTTP2 Control information that occurs when a UE connects, we need to distinguish whether it is roaming or not.

Let's take Authentication as an example.

When the UE sends an Authentication Request, the gNB receives it from the AMF.

It sends this control information to the AUSF via HTTP2.

If it is roaming, it sends it to the AUSF in the home PLMN, otherwise it sends it to the AUSF in my network.

Typically, the HTTP2 Control information contains the UE identifier.

For AMF, it is contained in the HTTP2 Control information in SUCI format, as shown in the figure below.

The SUCI contains the Home Network Identifier, or Home PLMN-ID.

Therefore, you can compare the Serving PLMN-ID received from the NRF with the Home Network Identifier in the SUCI format.

In AMF, it is easy to determine whether the HTTP2 Control information is Roaming or not.

SMFs do not have SUCI information.

It only knows the IMSI, which is derived from the SUPI.

As you probably know and have published, IMSI doesn't know if the MNC is 2 or 3 bytes.

This means that the correct Home PLMN-ID cannot be extracted from the HTTP2 Control information that is generated when the UE connects.

Here, Open5GS chose to use Full DNN.

Full DNN uses the FQDN method with the Network Operator created by the PLMN-ID described earlier.

This Full DNN is compared to the IMSI to determine if the MNC is 2 bytes or 3 bytes.

But there's one problem with this approach.

This is because AMFs made by different manufacturers may not send the full DNN.

The standard documentation explained it this way

For Home Routed, it says "shall be". So it should be sent as a Full DNN.

However, in Local Break Out or Non-Roaming, it says should be. This means that it may not be sent to the full DNN.

Therefore, if you are using LBO, it will not work properly with Open5GS unless the other manufacturer sends a full DNN.

If you have any other good suggestions, please let me know.

Currently, only LBO, in other words Local Break Out, is implemented.

As I mentioned a moment ago, it's that Local Break Out that other manufacturers' AMFs may not use as a Full DNN in LBO.

In LBO, UPF terminates on the Visited network.

Home Routed must send traffic to the UPF in Home.

Because of this difference, the Home Routed method requires SMF and NSSF in addition to the Home PLMN.

A property will be added to the Subscriber Database that distinguishes whether the subscriber is LBO or Home Routed.

UPF performance test results shared.

The reliability of this test is unknown.

However, the performance of Open5GS UPF is poor.

I started thinking about what to do with Open5GS UPF.

To improve performance, we can think of eBPF/XDP and DPDK/VPP technologies.

DPDK/VPP performs slightly better than eBPF/XDP, but is NIC-limited.

            Should Open5GS create its own UPF?

          <aside class="notes">
And, is it a good idea to re-implement Open5GS UPF with a new technology?

Alternatively, we can utilize an already developed eupf or UPG-VPP.

I'm still trying to figure out what to do with UPF.

I work in order of priority.

Bugs reported in Issues are prioritized.

I also need to address security vulnerabilities.

New features can be implemented in the remaining time.

Please understand if things don't happen as quickly as you'd like.
