Hi again, thanks for sticking around for the technical session. I'm back to dive deeper into what we've actually been building in Open5GS. Since this will be my last chance to take questions today - it's getting pretty late here in Korea and my kids need to sleep - please feel free to ask anything during or right after this presentation. I'll do my best to answer everything before the other speakers take over. Let me walk you through some of the more technical stuff we've been working on and where we're headed.

          <aside class="notes">
So let me start with what we've actually managed to get working recently. These took way longer than I initially thought they would, but I think we got them right.

The HTTP/2 over TLS support was necessary because 5G really moved away from the Diameter-heavy approach of 4G. Getting the TLS part right was tricky - you need different certificates for different scenarios, especially when operators need to talk to each other securely.

The SUCI implementation was something I felt we really needed. In 4G, if someone captures your S1AP traffic, they can potentially see subscriber identities. SUCI encrypts that, which feels like basic privacy protection these days.

UPF High Availability was probably the most complex piece. Making automatic failover work reliably took a lot of testing and debugging. There are so many edge cases when network components fail.

The roaming implementation... well, that was a journey. Both Local Breakout and Home-Routed scenarios with SEPP integration required basically redesigning how our components communicate with each other.

And the framed routing support came from user requests for IoT scenarios where one device needs to provide connectivity for multiple IP ranges. Pretty useful in practice.

          <aside class="notes">
The Prometheus integration was something users kept asking for, and honestly, I should have done it earlier. Monitoring is crucial if you want to run this stuff seriously.

We built a generic metrics API using prometheus-client-c, so each Open5GS process can serve metrics through a simple HTTP endpoint. Nothing fancy, but it works well with existing monitoring stacks. You can easily hook it up to Grafana or whatever monitoring setup you already have.

The tricky part was deciding which metrics actually matter and not overwhelming people with too much data. We tried to focus on the metrics that would actually help you understand what's happening in your network.

          <aside class="notes">
SEPP was probably our biggest architectural challenge. It's basically the secure gateway between different operator networks, but the tricky part is that when we first designed Open5GS's 5G core architecture, we didn't have SEPP in mind."

We had to rethink how network functions discover each other and route messages. It wasn't just adding another component - we basically had to redesign the service communication model. TLS is mandatory for the N32 interface between operators, but internal communications can stay HTTP for efficiency.

Getting the certificate management right was... let's say it took several iterations. Operators need to be able to trust each other's certificates while maintaining security isolation.

The old configuration system just couldn't handle the complexity we needed for roaming and SEPP. I had to basically throw it out and start over.

This new format might look complicated, but it gives operators the flexibility they actually need. You can see how we can set up different TLS certificates for different interfaces, configure defaults that make sense, and handle all the N32 interface requirements.

I know it's more complex than the old system, but real-world deployments need this kind of control. Different interfaces need different security settings, different certificates, different routing rules. The old system was too rigid for that.

          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
Roaming brought some really interesting technical challenges that aren't obvious until you try to implement them.

First, how do you route messages between operators? We use FQDN-based routing where each network function includes the operator's PLMN ID in its domain name. Sounds simple, but getting all the edge cases right took time.

The bigger challenge was figuring out if a subscriber is roaming, especially for SMF in Local Breakout scenarios. AMF gets the SUCI which clearly indicates the home network, but SMF only gets the IMSI. The problem is that some mobile country codes use 2 digits, others use 3, and you can't always tell just from the IMSI.

Our solution uses Full DNN - basically the complete domain name includes the operator identifier. It works reliably when everyone follows this approach, but it might cause interoperability issues with implementations that don't. There's an alternative approach using PLMN databases, but for simplicity, we went with Full DNN.

This complexity doesn't exist in Home Routed scenarios, which is why that's often the simpler deployment option.

          <aside class="notes">
Right now we're focused on finishing up Home-Routed roaming. The development is done, but I'm being careful with testing since roaming is one of those things that needs to work reliably.

UPF performance is honestly something I'm not entirely happy with yet. Our current implementation works, but it's not going to compete with specialized high-performance solutions. We're looking at eBPF/XDP to improve our existing UPF, or potentially integrating with solutions like eUPF or UPG-VPP that are designed for performance from the ground up.

Release-18 features are also on the roadmap. The 5G specs keep evolving, and we're trying to stay current with the important capabilities that people actually need.

          <aside class="notes">
The collaboration with Osmocom has been really valuable. They contributed the metrics support we just talked about, the Gy interface implementation, and ongoing improvements. Having experienced telecom developers contributing makes a huge difference.

We're seeing more industrial and research adoption, which is both exciting and a bit nerve-wracking because it means people are counting on this stuff to actually work. It definitely pushes us to focus on stability and proper testing.

Documentation is something I'm always trying to improve. 5G is complex enough without making it harder to understand how to actually deploy and use these systems.

          <aside class="notes">
This roadmap is what we're aiming for, though as any developer knows, timelines can be... optimistic.

Q2 should see Home-Routed roaming after we finish testing. That'll complete our roaming story.

Q3 is focused on Release-18 features and better operational tools. CLI improvements might not sound exciting, but they're important for people actually running these systems.

Q4 is when we tackle UPF performance optimization. That's going to be a significant effort, but it's necessary to make Open5GS competitive for high-throughput scenarios.
