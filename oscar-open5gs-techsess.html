Hello everyone, and thank you for staying with us. I'm Sukchan Lee, the lead developer of Open5GS. Today I'm excited to share what we've been working on in Open5GS - the recent developments we've completed, what we're currently focusing on, and where we're heading in the future. Open5GS has come a long way, and I want to give you insights into not just what we've built, but why we built it the way we did. I hope you'll find this continuation valuable.

Let me start with what we've accomplished recently. These are significant milestones that bring Open5GS closer to commercial-grade functionality.

First, HTTP/2 over TLS support. This is crucial because while 4G relied heavily on Diameter protocols, 5G has moved to HTTP/2 as the primary interface. TLS security is essential, especially for roaming scenarios where different operators need to communicate securely.

Second, we've implemented the 5G SUCI Profile A/B Scheme. This is a major privacy enhancement. In 4G, capturing S1AP traffic could expose subscriber identities. With SUCI, the subscriber's identity is encrypted, providing much better privacy protection.

Third, UPF High Availability with PFCP Restoration. This allows you to configure redundant UPFs and enables automatic recovery when either control plane or data plane components fail. The system detects failures through heartbeat mechanisms and seamlessly transfers sessions.

We've also completed our full 5G roaming implementation, including both Local Breakout and Home-Routed scenarios. This was one of our most challenging projects.

Finally, Framed Routing enables advanced IoT and enterprise scenarios where a single device provides connectivity for multiple IP ranges, along with comprehensive TLS support for production deployments.

          <aside class="notes">
Monitoring is critical for any production deployment. We've integrated Prometheus support throughout Open5GS, providing a generic API for counters, gauges, and other metrics.

This wasn't just about adding numbers - we built a comprehensive monitoring framework. Each Open5GS process can now serve metrics through an HTTP endpoint, making it easy to integrate with existing monitoring infrastructure.

The implementation uses prometheus-client-c, which gives us both the metric formatting and a lightweight HTTP server. This means you can easily integrate Open5GS with Grafana, Alertmanager, or any other Prometheus-compatible monitoring stack.

          <aside class="notes">
Now let me dive into our roaming implementation, which required significant architectural changes.

SEPP - the Security Edge Protection Proxy - is the gateway between different operator networks. It handles all the security, encryption, and message routing between operators.

The key challenge here was that traditional 5G core architectures weren't designed with SEPP in mind. We had to redesign how network functions discover each other and how they route messages. This wasn't just adding a new component - it required rethinking the entire service communication model.

TLS is mandatory for the N32 interface between SEPPs, while internal communications can remain HTTP. This creates a secure tunnel between operators while keeping internal operations efficient.

          <aside class="notes">
To support roaming and SEPP, we had to completely redesign our configuration system. The old format was too rigid for the complexity we needed.

The new system introduces clear separation between server and client configurations. You can see here how we can configure different TLS certificates for different interfaces, set up common defaults, and handle the complex N32 interface requirements.

This might seem like a lot of configuration, but it gives operators the flexibility they need for real-world deployments. We can now support scenarios where different interfaces need different security settings, different certificates, and different routing rules.

              Solving complex identity and routing challenges in multi-operator scenarios
            </small>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>FQDN-based routing using PLMN identifiers</li>
            <li>Full DNN requirement for accurate home network detection</li>
            <li>Certificate management for secure operator connections</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
Implementing roaming wasn't just about connecting networks - we had to solve some fundamental challenges. First, how do you route messages between operators? We use FQDN-based routing where each network function has a fully qualified domain name that includes the operator's PLMN ID. This allows automatic routing to the correct operator.
Second, determining if a subscriber is roaming. For AMF, this is straightforward - the SUCI contains the home network identifier. But for SMF, we only have the IMSI, which doesn't clearly indicate if the MNC is 2 or 3 digits. This problem specifically occurs in LBO (Local Breakout) scenarios.
Our solution uses Full DNN - a complete domain name that includes the operator identifier. In LBO deployments, we configure the system to use Full DNN, which allows us to compare it with the IMSI to calculate the Home PLMN. Of course, there's an alternative approach - maintaining a database of known PLMNs to determine whether they use 2 or 3 digits. However, for implementation simplicity, we chose the Full DNN approach.
It's worth noting that this complexity doesn't exist in Home Routed Roaming scenarios, where the traffic routing is more straightforward. This approach has trade-offs. It works reliably when all components use Full DNN in LBO scenarios, but might face interoperability challenges with implementations that don't follow this approach strictly.

          <aside class="notes">
Now let me tell you what we're currently working on.

Home-Routed roaming development is complete. Unlike Local Breakout where traffic stays in the visited network, Home-Routed sends all user traffic back to the home network. We're now in the testing phase and plan to release this in Q2 2025.

UPF performance is a key focus area. Our current UPF implementation, while functional, doesn't match the performance of specialized solutions. We're evaluating whether to enhance our existing UPF with eBPF/XDP technology or integrate with high-performance alternatives like eUPF or UPG-VPP.

We're also working on implementing Release-18 features, which bring advanced 5G capabilities and enhanced network function behaviors that will be important for next-generation use cases.

Open5GS continues to grow as a community project. Our collaboration with Osmocom has been particularly valuable - they've contributed metrics support, Gy interface implementation, and ongoing improvements.

We're seeing increased adoption in industrial and research environments, which drives us to focus on stability and performance. We've also been improving our documentation and tutorials, making it easier for new users to get started with 5G core networks.

The community feedback helps us prioritize features and improvements that matter most for real-world deployments.

Thank you for your attention. Open5GS has evolved significantly, and we're excited about the future. We're building not just a 5G core network, but a platform that enables innovation and deployment across various scenarios - from research and development to industrial IoT and edge computing.
I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have about Open5GS, our implementation choices, or future plans. However, I should mention that it's quite late here in Korea - it's nighttime and my children are sleeping, so I need to keep my voice down. If you have questions that require detailed vocal responses, perhaps we could address them through our GitHub discussions or Discord community where I can provide more comprehensive written answers.
You can also find more information on our website and GitHub repository. The 5G ecosystem is rapidly evolving, and Open5GS aims to be your reliable foundation for exploring and deploying these new capabilities.
